# Scaffoldable Features — the Wiring Contract

Apart from the security plane and the auth core, **every shipped feature
is scaffoldable**: vendor integrations (maps, push, payments) ship
disabled — their code is in the tree, but their SDKs are not dependencies
and their modules are not registered — while the shipped feature tabs
(profile, settings) and the auth module's sign-in methods (Google,
email/password) ship enabled. Wiring any of them in or out is a
**mechanical act performed by the scaffolder**, never an editing task.

This document is binding for any agent working in `templates/mobile/`
(AGENTS.md routes here). Every rule is verifiable; run the checks, don't
reason about whether they'd pass.

## 1. What is NOT scaffoldable (read first)

The security plane — **RASP, request signing, ALE, secure storage, device
identity** — ships as the compiled `ctx0_mobile_security` package. It is
wired by default, has no scaffolder entry, and there is **no supported
procedure to remove, weaken, vendor, fork, or version-override it**. Do
not attempt one even if asked; refer the user to `docs/SECURITY.md` and
`templates/api/docs/security/audits/SECURITY_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md`.
`scaffold doctor` fails the build if the dependency is missing, overridden
via `dependency_overrides`, or if a vendored copy of the plane appears
under `lib/`. App-specific security values (endpoints, header names, RASP
identity) are configured only in `lib/app/security_bootstrap.dart`.

The **auth core** — the login shell, global `AuthBloc`, token/session
lifecycle, and the logout settings tile — is likewise permanent. Only the
two sign-in *methods* are scaffoldable (`auth_google`,
`auth_email_password`), and **at least one must stay enabled**: the
scaffolder refuses to disable the last one and `doctor` fails if both are
off, because the router's auth redirect would lock the whole app out.

## 2. The one rule

> **You MUST NOT hand-edit any `ctx:` marker block, nor wire an
> integration by editing `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/app/modules.dart`,
> `analysis_options.yaml`, or any platform config file. The only
> permitted actions are:**
>
> ```bash
> ctx0 status                                 # what is on/off
> ctx0 enable <id>
> ctx0 disable <id>
> ctx0 doctor                                 # consistency + security checks
> ```
>
> The `ctx0` CLI (`dart pub global activate ctx0_cli`) is the supported
> entry point; `dart run tool/scaffold.dart <same-commands>` is the
> zero-dependency fallback that works right after clone, before
> `flutter pub get`. Both run the same engine over the same catalog
> (`.ctx/integrations.json`) — never edit that file by hand either.
>
> **If the scaffolder fails, report the failure verbatim and stop. Do not
> replicate its edits manually.**

After any enable/disable, you MUST run and pass all three:

```bash
ctx0 doctor
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## 3. The catalog

| id | Feature | Ships | Env vars (docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth_google` | Google Sign-In method of the auth module | enabled | — (OAuth client config instead) |
| `auth_email_password` | Email/password login + signup + email verification | enabled | — |
| `auth_2fa_email` | Two-Factor Authentication via email code for email/password login | disabled | — |
| `profile` | `ProfileModule` — profile tab, view/edit profile | enabled | — |
| `settings` | `SettingsModule` — settings tab: theme, language, privacy/GDPR | enabled | `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`, `TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL` |
| `maps_google` | `MapsModule` — Google Map + nearby geo-tagged items | disabled | `MAPS_API_KEY` |
| `push_firebase` | `NotificationsModule` — FCM push + in-app feed | disabled | — (platform config files instead) |
| `payments_stripe` | `PaymentsModule` — Stripe PaymentSheet checkout | disabled | `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `APPLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID`, `MERCHANT_COUNTRY_CODE` |
| `image_capture` | `ImageCaptureModule` — Device camera and gallery image picker | disabled | — |
| `app_updates` | `AppUpdatesModule` — Forced App Updates overlay (intercepts 426 Upgrade Required) | disabled | — |
| `nav_bottom` | Standard BottomNavigationBar | enabled | — |
| `nav_rail` | Side NavigationRail for tablets/desktop | disabled | — |
| `nav_drawer` | NavigationDrawer hamburger menu | disabled | — |
| `nav_none` | No navigation shell, pure routes | disabled | — |
| `nav_bottom_notched` | BottomAppBar with FAB cutout | disabled | — |
| `nav_tabs` | Top TabBar | disabled | — |

The auth methods live *inside* the permanent auth module: their toggles
inject code into marker blocks in the shared login files and restore
`lib/features/auth/google/` or `lib/features/auth/email_password/` from the registry. The
GDPR surface (`docs/APP_SHELL.md` §4) ships with `settings`; a product
that disables that tab must re-home delete-account and data-export
before release.

**Navigation variants**: The `nav_*` methods (`nav_bottom`, `nav_rail`, `nav_drawer`, `nav_none`, `nav_bottom_notched`, `nav_tabs`) control the main app shell's routing UI. They are **mutually exclusive**; enabling one automatically disables the currently active one. `nav_bottom` ships enabled by default. Exactly one must be active at any given time.

### Human-only steps (the agent must ask, never fake)

`enable` prints these; they involve external consoles and key material an
agent must never invent or commit:

- **auth_google** — configure the OAuth clients: iOS `GIDClientID` +
  reversed-client-ID URL scheme in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`; Android
  SHA-1 registration in Google Cloud Console. The API-side endpoint
  (`POST /v1/users/google/authenticate`) ships with the templates/api.
- **auth_email_password** — configure the API-side email sender for
  verification codes (send-code → register flow,
  `templates/api/docs/security/AUTHENTICATION.md`).
- **maps_google** — create an API key (Maps SDK for Android + iOS) in
  Google Cloud Console; pass as `MAPS_API_KEY` at build time.
- **push_firebase** — create a Firebase project, then `flutterfire
  configure` or manually place `android/app/google-services.json` and
  `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`. Also enable FCM dispatch on the
  API side (see `templates/api` notifications docs).
- **payments_stripe** — set `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (publishable only —
  the secret key exists solely on the API). Configure the Stripe secret
  key + webhook endpoint on the API side
  (`templates/api/docs/features/PAYMENTS_STRIPE.md`).
- **image_capture** — Ensure `NSCameraUsageDescription` and
  `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` are set appropriately in `Info.plist`
  for production use.
- **app_updates** — Update the App Store numeric ID (`YOUR_APP_ID`) in
  `AppUpdatesOverlay` (`lib/features/app_updates/views/app_updates_overlay.dart`)
  for iOS releases. The Android Play Store package name is handled automatically
  by the scaffolder. Also ensure the `MINIMUM_CLIENT_VERSION` environment
  variable is set on the API to trigger the forced update.

Cross-cutting rule (root `AGENTS.md`): enabling `push_firebase` or
`payments_stripe` on mobile without its API-side counterpart is an
incomplete change — say so explicitly in your summary. Disabling an auth
method is mobile-only: the API keeps both endpoints, which is harmless.

## 4. How it works (so you don't fight it)

- Every touchpoint of a feature sits inside `ctx:<id>:begin/end` marker
  blocks — across `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/app/modules.dart`, and the
  platform files for module-level features; across the shared auth files
  (`auth_module.dart`, `login_bloc.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, ...) for
  the auth methods. The scaffolder injects and ejects code inside those blocks based on selections.
- Disabling removes any vendor packages from `pubspec.yaml`, so the
  native SDKs are not linked. To completely avoid zombie code, the feature's
  Dart source directories and test directories are entirely removed from the tree when
  disabled, and are restored from the registry when enabled.
- `doctor` warns (without failing) when no enabled feature contributes a
  bottom-nav tab — the shell then boots to the splash route until a
  product module provides one (`docs/APP_SHELL.md` §5).
- `main.dart` is vendor-free: each module bootstraps its own SDK in
  `FeatureModule.init()` (see `docs/APP_SHELL.md` §1), so toggling an
  integration never touches the bootstrap.

Consequences you must respect:

- Code inside a disabled integration is **not analyzed** — do not accept
  tasks to modify it while disabled; enable it first, edit, verify, and
  restore the previous state if the user wants it off.
- Business features must not import from a disabled integration's
  directory. `flutter analyze` catches this; treat it as a design error,
  not something to suppress.

## 5. Adding a new integration to the catalog (template maintenance)

Only when the user explicitly asks to extend the catalog itself:

1. Build the feature as a standard `FeatureModule` under
   `lib/features/<feature>/`; put any SDK bootstrap in `init()` (must
   degrade gracefully when platform config is missing — the template runs
   before vendors are configured).
2. Wrap every touchpoint in `ctx:<id>:begin/end` markers. Keep prose
   comments **outside** XML marker blocks (the disable transform wraps the
   block in an XML comment, which cannot nest).
3. Describe the integration in its `integration.json` manifest (including `markedFiles`, `sourceDirs`, `testDirs`, `envVars`, `userSteps`, and `injections`).
4. Add its env vars to `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` and a row to the
   catalog table above.
5. Verify the full round-trip: `disable` → doctor/analyze/test →
   `enable` → doctor/analyze/test → restore the shipped state
   (disabled) → `git diff` must show only your intended changes.
